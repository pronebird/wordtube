wordTube is your Media Center plugin for WordPress.

== Description ==

The wordTube Plugin creates your personal "YouTube" in wordpress.
Together with the fantastic Flash Media Player from Jeroen Wijering you
are able to show very easy your streaming videos.

wordTube supports the streaming video format (Format .flv or .swf), 
sound files as MP3 and JPG, GIF or PNG grafic files. 
With wordTube you can simply insert it into your blog with the 
tag [MEDIA=ID] or as playlist [MYPLAYLIST=ID].

You don't need to change the WYSIWYG mode or special HTML knowledge 
to insert such a tag. You can show a simple media file (i.e. a flv Format) 
or a playlist of all your media files. And I integrate in the header the 
SWFobject script to prevent the annoying "click here to activate"
message (for the Internet Explorer) when you use the Flash player.
