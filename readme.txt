wordTube is your Media Center plugin for WordPress.

== Description ==

This plugin manages the JW FLV MEDIA PLAYER 4.3 and makes it easy for 
you to put music, videos or flash movies onto your WordPress posts and pages. 
Various skins for the JW PLAYER are available via www.longtailvideo.com 

wordTube supports the streaming video format (Format .flv or .swf), 
sound files as MP3 and JPG, GIF or PNG grafic files. 
With wordTube you can simply insert it into your blog with the 
tag [media id="media id"] or as playlist [playlist id="playlist id"].

Since Version 2.0 it supports LongTail's AdSolution which allows you 
to run pre-roll, overlay mid-roll, and post-roll advertisements in your media player.

You don't need to change the WYSIWYG mode or special HTML knowledge 
to insert such a tag. You can show a simple media file (i.e. a flv Format) 
or a playlist of all your media files..
